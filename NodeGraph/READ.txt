Project Description
NodeGraph is a lightweight C# Windows Forms Control that allows to design & create Node Tree Graphs in your application.

Requirements:

.NET 3.0
Visual C# 2010
Currently, these features are available:

[NEW!] Node Shadows, new event onNodePostDraw, & dynamic spawning from different assemblies.
[NEW!} Copy & Paste! of Nodes + Links
Create a NodeGraphPanel into your form and setup look and feel (colors, link hardness, etc.)
Navigate NodeGraphPanel: panning, zooming.
Add nodes to the NodeGraphPanel, move them, multiple select them.
Create and destroy links between nodes.
Delete nodes and corresponding links.
Inherit default NodeGraphNode to create custom Nodes
Logic & Data transport through nodes, with error collection.
Node comments.
Node color validation.
Make node unselectable.
Node Layouts can be saved and loaded from XML.
Template: Sample IfNode with comment to start creating custom nodes.

The project is currently in a testing phase; there are many refactors incoming, so please be advised that methods and fields are subject to be obsoleted or removed.
